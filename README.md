# Creating-contracts-from-a-Contract

In this brief tutotrial, I coded and explained the truism of creating factory contracts which will be able to create several children contracts in Solidity.

## Motivation

I have always wondered if we can create a contract that can be repurposing other contracts from within itself. To me, it was mere fantasy. Not until I came across the Factory Contract pattern.

## What I Learned from this

I learned more specifically about the "new" keyword in Solidity. It is really the major game-changer in creating Factory contracts. Moving on, I learned that the Factory contract pattern can save us tons on time to create separate contracts for each contract of the same class.

I also got to know that Uniswap uses this opcode to create vaults. So what I just learned now will be extremely helpful in my day-to-day journey as a blockchain developer.

## How to Use the Factory Contract in this Code Base to Create new Contracts

* deploy the contract
* use the "create" function to create sub-contracts of 4 car models
* insert the number of each of them in the array, that will let you know their addresses
* you can pass their addresses into the constructor to test out their model

That would be all for now. By the way, if you want to hire a writer who does not only know the art of writing well but is also into engineering, please reach out to me now. Thanks!
